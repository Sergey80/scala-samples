// As we saw in the previous example, it was questionable whether we needed Cats at all.
// It seemed like an overkill‚Äîwe could have achieved the same result with simple Scala or even TypeScript.
// But now, as we progress, we begin to see why it's not exactly overkill.
// Looking at the retry example, we realize where Cats truly shines.

// --- So, why is cats-retry better than a simple manual retry? ---

/**
 * A naive approach: Manually implementing retries.
 *
 * The following function attempts to retry a failing task a given number of times.

  And yet, it maybe not enought, think twice, if you tink scala + casts introduce more complexity to your code,
  the code, that very soon will lose its value, because I is to be written by AI, not people
  (for people is to know what to write, to know the user stories), people will be read it,
 then ask yourse this: what language would be the best for you as human to read the code

 Consider this TS code for example:

  import { TaskEither, tryCatch, taskEither } from 'fp-ts/lib/TaskEither';
  import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/lib/function';
  import { delay } from 'fp-ts-contrib/lib/Task';
  import { right, left } from 'fp-ts/lib/Either';
  import { retrying, RetryPolicy, limitRetries, constantDelay, exponentialBackoff } from 'fp-ts-contrib/lib/Retry';

  // üé≠ Simulated unstable API call (fails the first 3 times, succeeds on 4th attempt)
  let attemptCount = 0;
  const callUnstableApi: TaskEither<Error, string> = tryCatch(
    async () => {
      attemptCount++;
      if (attemptCount <= 3) {
        throw new Error("API failed");
      }
      return "API Response";
    },
    (reason) => (reason instanceof Error ? reason : new Error(String(reason)))
  );

  // üõ† Define retry policies
  const maxRetries = 3;
  const retryPolicy: RetryPolicy = limitRetries(maxRetries)
    .concat(constantDelay(1000)); // ‚è≥ 1s delay per retry
  // Alternative: Use exponential backoff instead of constant delay
  // const retryPolicy = limitRetries(maxRetries).concat(exponentialBackoff(500));

  // üìå Logging function for retry attempts
  const onError = (error: Error, attempts: number): TaskEither<Error, void> =>
    tryCatch(
      async () => console.log(`Retry #${attempts}: ${error.message}`),
      () => undefined
    );

  // üöÄ Retry the API call with a policy
  const retryingCall = retrying(retryPolicy, callUnstableApi, onError);

  // üî• Execute the retrying call
  retryingCall().then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
});

// So choose your language carefully‚Äîone that you can write quickly and read without struggle.
// Maybe, to build a web app, you don't need knowledge of Abstract Algebra or rocket science.
